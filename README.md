# rugb-f24-demo
demo for Bucknell R Users Group in Fall '24

Get ready for your Spotify Unwrapped to drop this year....


- `0_gettingSetup.R`: installing and loading R packages, getting and storing credentials to access APIs
- `1_getData.R`: get data from Spotify based on a playlist id, get lyrics from Genius based on an artist name and a song title
- `2_initial_summaries.R`: initial exploration of the data
- `3_further_feature_exploration.R`: more comprehensive exploration of the data

**data/**
- This is where I saved the data I gathered. I'm not pushing this here, but there is a sample directory for you to use if you want to follow along.

**helper_code/**
- I had to hack some of the `geniusr` code to get it to work, and I adapted a visualization tool so that it would do what I wanted. You don't have to pay attention to the inner workings of this code to make progress.
